## Recommendation System
We are going to make recommendation system or recommender sytem to give user recommendation for traveling based on their preference.

## Datasets
- Dummy Dataset
  We formed our dataset, it consist of eight categories, such as place_id, place_name, city, address, desc_place, Lon, Lat, price, category_1, category_2, category_3

## Models
The model is using Tensorflow Recommender System (TFRS). We use retrieval model.

## Results
    - `Loss = 1.48`
    - `factorized_top_k/top_50_categorical_accuracy': 0.23`
    - `factorized_top_k/top_100_categorical_accuracy': 1.0`

## Dependecies
